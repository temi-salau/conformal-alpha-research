# Conformal Alpha Research

**Status:** Work in Progress

Research project investigating market regime detection and systematic alpha generation using Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty Quantification. Developed as independent coursework extending concepts from my Machine Learning module, this project implements a modular Python pipeline for financial feature engineering, stationarity analysis, and vectorised backtesting.

## About

This project explores how conformal prediction methods can be applied to quantitative finance, specifically:
- Market regime detection using uncertainty quantification
- Systematic alpha signal generation with confidence intervals
- Stationary time series analysis for financial data
- Vectorised backtesting framework with transaction cost modelling

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas (data processing)
- Scikit-learn (ML models)
- Parquet (efficient data caching)

## Project Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1:** Project Infrastructure & Data Pipeline ✓
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Feature Engineering & Alpha Signals
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Conformal Prediction & Model Training
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Vectorised Backtesting & Transaction Costs
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Performance Reporting & Documentation

## Background

Building on concepts from my university's Machine Learning module (conformal prediction, ridge regression, SVMs), this project applies these techniques to financial markets to quantify prediction uncertainty and detect market regimes.
